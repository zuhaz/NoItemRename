# NoItemRename
NoItemRename offers a simple yet effective solution for server administrators who want to prevent players from renaming items using anvils. Whether you're running a survival, roleplay, or competitive server, maintaining consistency with item names can be crucial. This lightweight plugin ensures that all items retain their original names, adding a layer of control and preventing potential exploits or item confusion.
